# Basic-Haskell
Some basic Haskell functions.

TASK 1A: 

faca::Int->Int
faca x

This function calculates the factorial using pattern match-ching


Task 1B: 

facb::Int->Int
facb x

This function calculates the factorial using guards.


Task 2A:

nulpuntenb::Double->Double->Double->[Double]
nulpuntenb a b c

This function calculates the zeros of a second degree function using the wherekeyword and guards.


TASK 2B:

We roll three dice. Write a function that returns a list of all possible throws. To represent ́e ́en throw use wetuples, eg (1,2,3). Write the function such that only the throws whose sum of eyes is a multiple of five are included in the list. What is the number of throws?


TASK 2D:

Rewrite the function from assignment 2c such that the list of tuples is a multiple of n.
